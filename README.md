# cl-game-math (alpha-ish)

This system provides a selection of the math routines most commonly needed for making games in lisp.

Currently it is working but is not api stable, I will be making changes as needed. Also there is a lot of room for performance improvements (sb-cga is definitely doing a better job there)
